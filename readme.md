## What is this?
This is just a little proof of concept, showing how easily you can set up a node server, a custom API and a little Backbone app that interacts with the data. The movie titles and ratings are persisted in a simple [NeDB database](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb).

### What is it built with?
**Server**
- Node

**API**
- Express
- NeDB

**Build tool**
- Gulp

**Frontend**
- Backbone
- CoffeeScript
- SASS
- Twitter Bootstrap

### How do I run this?
1. `$ npm install`
2. `$ bower install`
3. `$ node api.js`
4. Go to http://localhost:8080 in your browser.
